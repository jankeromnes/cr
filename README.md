# CR

`cr` is a tool to help you work on the Chromium browser sources

## What can it do for me?

- Download fresh Chromium sources (`cr clone`)
- Autoinstall Chromium depot\_tools and dependencies (`cr clone` makes sure you have everything)
- Build the latest Chromium browser (`cr build`)
- Update ALL the source codes (`cr update`)

And also...

- Help to skip builds for Web Inspector (`cr devtools` sets up hard links for inspector files)

## What not?

- Run Chromium (soon)
- Help doing Chromium patches (soon)
- Help doing Blink patches (soon)
